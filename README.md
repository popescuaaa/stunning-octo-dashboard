## A *clean* React Dashboard

---

### Description

This is a React Dashboard template. It is a work in progress. The goal is to have a clean, easy to use, easy to extend code base which can be used as a starting point for any dashboard or landing page with analytics.

### Out of the box usage

The project can be used out of the box. It is a React app with a small component library. The components are styled with tailwind. The project uses react-router-dom for routing.  

The testing part is in progress and will be added soon using jest and react-testing-library.
